Hierarchy Icons
===============

See at a glance what components are attached to game objects in your scene.
Hierarchy Icons displays icons beside each item in the Hierarchy pane making
it easy to see, say, where your cameras are, which game objects are lights,
and which objects have an audio source attached. Think of it as Gizmos for the
editor.

No setup needs to be done after importing the package. If you wish to turn off
individual icons, navigate to the Hierarchy Icons pane in Unity's preferences.
