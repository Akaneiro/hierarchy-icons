# Hierarchy Icons

See at a glance what components are attached to game objects in your scene with
this editor extension for Unity. Icons beside each item in the Hierarchy pane
make it easy to see where your cameras are, which game objects are lights, and
which objects have an audio source attached. Think of it as Gizmos for the
editor.


## Usage

No setup is necessary after importing the files. To turn off individual icons,
navigate to the Hierarchy Icons pane in Unity's preferences.
