Hierarchy Icons is an editor extension for Unity (the
[game engine](http://unity3d.com/)) that displays icons in the Hierarchy of
components attached to game objects. This allows you to see at a glance where
your cameras are, which game objects are light sources, and which objects have
an audio source attached. Think of it as
[Gizmos](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos.html) for
the editor.

The package will be available for purchased and download from the Unity Asset
Store soon.
